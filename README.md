Portal
=====

This is the old Portal source code ported to Source Engine 2013. I made this because I wanted to make proper Half-Life 2 with Portal gun, but I have no idea how to fix all of the bugs that occur in Portal on Half-Life 2 maps (like Metrocops not shooting bullets, various glitches with portals etc.). So I hope someone more experienced with Source engine will help me fix them.

## Current Differences from original Portal
* You can fizzle portals by reloading portal gun
* Health regeneration is disabled without annoying red tint and there is fall damage now
* Flashlight is enabled
* NPCs can actually shoot you now

## Dependencies

### Windows
* [Visual Studio 2013 with Update 5](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)

### macOS
* [Xcode 5.0.2](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/more)

### Linux
* GCC 4.8
* [Steam Client Runtime](http://media.steampowered.com/client/runtime/steam-runtime-sdk_latest.tar.xz)

## Building

Compiling process is the same as for Source SDK 2013. Instructions for building Source SDK 2013 can be found here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013

You will need to copy assets from your copy of Portal though

## Installing:

Same as Source SDK 2013 mod: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Setup_mod_on_steam
